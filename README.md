This script provides a basic market forecasting model that leverages a simulated machine learning (ML) approach using gradient boosting to predict price movements over a specified horizon.
It integrates key technical indicators (RSI, MACD, VWAP, Stochastic, and more) along with dynamic features like volume thresholds, volatility, and multi-timeframe confirmations
for more reliable signal generation.

Important Notes:
This script is a base version and, while quite solid, it still requires further tuning to fit different market conditions and personal strategies. Key areas that could be refined include:

Feature Weighting: The ML weights are randomly initialized; for more accuracy, these can be optimized using backtesting or more sophisticated ML methods.
Risk Management: While the script includes a dynamic stop-loss, more advanced risk management logic could be integrated based on portfolio size or leverage.
Performance Testing: Extensive backtesting and performance optimization should be done before applying it to live trading scenarios.
Overall, this script provides a strong foundation for developing a more advanced forecasting tool, but adjustments and refinements are necessary to enhance accuracy and performance 
in different market environments.
